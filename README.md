## Features

* **The PicAxe Tool**: A new tool used to store an image URL. Simply sneak right-click with it in hand to open a GUI and paste your link.
* **Image Beds**: Convert any vanilla bed into a custom Image Bed. Apply your chosen image and cycle through different rendering styles, like full drapes or just as the sheet.
* **Image Banners**: Convert vanilla banners into Image Banners. Your custom image will wave in the wind and can even be applied to shields.
* **Image Shields**: Craft a custom Image Banner with a regular shield to create a unique Image Shield that displays your chosen picture.
* **6-Sided Image Block**: A versatile new block that can have a different image applied to each of its six faces.
* **Image Frame**: A placeable frame that can be resized from 1x1 up to 6x6 blocks. You can configure it to either stretch the image to fit or maintain its original aspect ratio.
* **Easy to Use**: A simple, unified system—**right-click** with the PicAxe—is used to apply images and configure all custom blocks.

## How to Use

1.  **Get an Image URL**: Find an image online that you want to use. Copy the URL to your clipboard.
2.  **Use the PicAxe Tool**: Craft a PicAxe (see recipe below). Hold it in your hand and **right-click** in the air to open the URL input screen. Paste your URL and click "Confirm". The URL is now stored on your PicAxe.
3.  **Apply an Image**:
    * **To a vanilla bed, banner, or block**: **right-click** on the block with the PicAxe in hand. This will convert it into its "Image" version and apply the stored URL.
    * **To an existing Image Block**: right-clicking will apply a new image from your PicAxe.
4.  **Configure Render Types**:
    * If you right-click on an **Image Bed*** with a PicAxe that has the *same URL* already applied, you will cycle through its different render styles (e.g., drapes, full cover).
5.  **Configure the 6-Sided Image Block**:
    * Apply an image by right-clicking on a specific face of the block. The image will be applied only to that face.
6.  **Configure the Image Frame**:
    * First, apply an image with the PicAxe like any other block.
    * Then, right-click the Image Frame again to open its configuration GUI. Here you can set the width, height, and stretch mode.
7.  **Create an Image Shield**:
    * Place a regular Shield and an Image Banner in a crafting grid. The resulting Image Shield will have the banner's image applied to it.
